ParallelFox Examples
====================
These examples demonstrate the various features of ParallelFox.  

The examples can be run either from the ParallelFox folder:

	DO EXAMPLES\STEPS_AFTER.PRG

... or from inside the examples folder:

	CD EXAMPLES
	DO STEPS_AFTER.PRG
	
It is recommended you issue CLEAR ALL before running each example program.

Some examples include "_before" and "_after" versions to demonstrate how a program is transformed for use with ParallelFox.

Examples were designed to demonstrate parallel processing techniques, not strictly for performance.  On a quad-core machine, it is possible to achieve a nearly four-fold increase in performance.  However, you may not see that with these examples.  It depends on your scenario.

It is recommended you review the training videos and blogs associated with these examples from the main ParallelFox page on VFPX:
