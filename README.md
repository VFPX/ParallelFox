# ParallelFox
**Parallel Processing Library for Visual FoxPro**

Project Manager: [Joel Leach](https://github.com/JoelLeach)

ParallelFox is a parallel processing library for Visual FoxPro 9.0.

Although parallel processing and multi-threading have been possible in VFP for quite some time (particularly in web servers), the goal of this project is the same as parallel processing libraries that have been popping up for other development platforms. That is, to make parallel processing easier and more approachable, without all of the headaches typically associated with multi-threaded programming. This has become more important as multi-core desktop and server machines have become widespread.

## Documentation
ParallelFox includes complete documentation (ParallelFox.chm).  The Help file is designed to be used in conjunction with the training videos below. Use the Help file as a quick reference or short overview of topics. Watch the training videos for more in-depth discussions, examples, and techniques.

ParallelFox also takes advantage of Doug Hennig's [Favorites for IntelliSense](http://www.stonefield.com/techpap.aspx), which Doug also used in the [MY project for Sedna](http://vfpx.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Sedna#MY). This greatly simplifies the ParallelFox interfaces and provides extra details while you are coding. 

## Installation
- Download and unzip the latest stable release from the Releases page. Grab **ParallelFox_x.x.zip**, rather than the Source Code zip file GitHub automatically creates.
  - Alternatively, you can clone the repository or download the latest files, although this may contain experimental/unstable changes. As a minimum, you need all files in the root ParallelFox folder, as well as the **ffi** subdirectory.  
- **DO INSTALL** to register ParallelFox.exe and install the IntelliSense scripts.  
- See the "Installation" topic in the Help file for details.
## Training Videos
These videos were recorded at a fairly high resolution.  If the Flash version does not fit in your browser window, give the WMV version a try.

Errata: In this video, I said that CPU speeds topped out a 3-4 "Megahertz", which was about the speed of my first computer, a [PCjr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pcjr).  I should have said "Gigahertz".  It's only a thousand-fold difference. :)
